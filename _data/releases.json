The new format is `data-[identifier]-target=\"[name]\"` instead of `data-target=\"[identifier].[name]\"`. You can still use the old syntax, but you will see a warning in the console, and support will be removed in a future version.\r\n\r\nThe data map API from Stimulus 1.0 will continue to work but is no longer documented and should be considered internal. We suggest migrating to the new values API. "
